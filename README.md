# Voxels-From-Heightmap-Unity
Generate Voxel worlds from heightmap Images, MonoBehaviour, ECS, GPU Indirect (needs GPU Instancer Pro asset)
Heightmap Generator is included. You can find the repo here: (https://github.com/GameDevBox/HeightmapGeneratorUnity)
### How To Use:
- Download the Script folder and import it.

- Attach the script to an empty gameobject and fill the properties.

- There are 3 versions:
- MonoBehaviour, just attach it to a script and click on the Generate Button.
- ECS, you need to make a subscene. Also, remember to import the entity package and attach the VoxelAuthoring to the entity gameobject and fill the properties.
- The next one is with GPU Indirect, which gives you the best performance, but you need [GPUInstancerPro](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/gpu-instancer-pro-290293?clickref=1100lAsVA4SC&utm_source=partnerize&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=unity_affiliate).
